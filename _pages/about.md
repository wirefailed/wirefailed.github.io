👋 Hi there! My name is Junsoo Kim.

💻 I am currently sophomore student at USC, studying Physics/CS.
👶 I will introduce more about myself!

## Current Project
🖍️ Since 2024, I have been self-studying Machine Learning during my free time. I am particularly interested in the mathematics behind Stable Diffusion and plan to share my annotated notes once I complete them.

I enjoy exploring various subfields of Machine Learning. If you are interested in starting a project, feel free to contact me!

📚 In addition to this, I am currently reading papers on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and have attempted to implement Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in a 3D environment. Unfortunately, my computer couldn't handle the computational load, but I'm eager to continue learning and experimenting in this area.

## Hobbies and Interests
🎥 When I am not on my computer, I like to watch old classic movies or new releases! I have been a fan of all kinds of movies since childhood. Recently, I watched "Forrest Gump" without knowing the plot and with no expectations. To my surprise, I quite enjoyed it, especially seeing Forrest's resilience throughout his life.

📕 These days, I try to read as much as possible! I am currently reading "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman." I highly recommend it to anyone reading my page. As someone interested in physics, I thoroughly enjoyed his anecdotes and found his perspective on the world fascinating.

💪 Going to the gym has become an essential part of my life. It is a key part of my daily routine. If you're interested in my workout program, I follow a Push-Pull-Legs (PPL) routine!

## Where I am from

I jokingly tell my friends: "Manufactured in Korea. Assembled in Vancouver. Sold in Los Angeles." Try to guess what that means."
