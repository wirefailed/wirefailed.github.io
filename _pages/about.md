👋 Hi there! My name is Junsoo Kim.

💻 I am currently sophomore student at USC, studying Physics/CS.
👶 I will introduce more about myself!

## Current Project
🖍️ Since 2024, I have been self-studying Machine Learning during my free time. I am currently working on developing Swift app and planning to publish it during this academic year.

I enjoy exploring various subfields of Machine Learning. If you are interested in starting a project, feel free to contact me!

📚 In addition to this, I am currently refining my understanding of Deep Reinforcement Learning. I will share few chapters at a time in blog to keep in track of my insights.

## Hobbies and Interests
🎥 When I am not on my computer, I enjoy watching both classic movies and new releases! I have been a fan of all kinds of films since childhood. Recently, I watched Snowpiercer, which fascinated me with its portrayal of a plausible dystopia that could occur in the future.

📕 These days, I try to read as much as possible! I have recently completed "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman." I highly recommend it to anyone reading my page. I am starting on "Cosmos" by Carl Sagan

💪 Going to the gym has become an essential part of my life. It is a key part of my daily routine. If you're interested in my workout program, I follow a Push-Pull-Legs (PPL) routine!
