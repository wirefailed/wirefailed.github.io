Web Scrapper for College Professor's educational background utilizing Python and Beautiful Soup 4. The project grabs data from a set URL - in this case the USC Viterbi faculty page. From the faculty page, the webscraper finds all the professor's individual pages. Afterwards, the webscraper then scrapes each professor's individual page to college information such as name, occupation, and degrees from the individual professor. We have accounted for possible internet errors through keeping track of the URLs of professors the first run did not receive information for. The data is then stored in a local database by last name order.
